I am a PhD student in Data Science & Informatics (Bioinformatics) at the University of Missouri, where my research focuses on applying AI and advanced analytics to healthcare challenges. In Dr. Ai-Ling Lin’s lab, I analyze multi-omic datasets to identify biomarkers driving Alzheimer’s disease and explore AI-driven drug repurposing strategies. In Dr. Changyu Sun’s lab, I work on improving MRI image acquisition methods to reduce scan times and enhance diagnostic accuracy.

&nbsp;

I hold a B.S. in Statistics (Data Science concentration) with a minor in Mathematics from Truman State University, where I also served as a Teaching Assistant and Student Advisor. During my time there, I gained practical experience through internships at SelectQuote, applying NLP, optimization, and predictive modeling to business problems, and through research and consulting projects in data analysis and visualization.

&nbsp;

In addition, I founded RgentAI LLC, where I developed AI-powered data science assistants and full-stack applications that help bridge the gap between machine learning research and practical use cases. This portfolio highlights a diverse range of my projects—from statistical modeling and NLP pipelines to healthcare research and software development—that showcase both my technical skills and my drive to make a meaningful impact through data science.
