# Analysis of Kansas City Royals Baseball Data

## Introduction
This report presents an in-depth analysis of Kansas City Royals baseball 2024 season data, 
focusing on pitching performance using statistical and machine learning techniques. The analysis leverages `dplyr` for data cleaning, `ggplot2` for visualization, and `tidymodels` for predictive modeling. 

This project was completed in six hours from coming up with a research questions, creating visualizations, predictice models, and key takeaways. We did this to practice for DataFest, a regional data competition, the following week.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(randomForest)
library(vip)
library(caret)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Data Cleaning
### Data Source
The data is collected from https://statds.org/events/csas2025/challenge.html that provides over 700,000 rows and 113 columns on the 2024 MLB season. A vector of KC Royals hitters is created for future use in our data cleaning.
```{r}
# Vector of Kansas City Royals Hitters
kc_batters <- c(
  "Witt Jr., Bobby", "Perez, Salvador", "Garcia, Maikel", 
  "Pasquantino, Vinnie", "Melendez, MJ", "Renfroe, Hunter",
  "Isbel, Kyle", "Fermin, Freddy", "Massey, Michael",
  "Frazier, Adam", "Hampson, Garrett", "Velazquez, Nelson",
  "Loftin, Nick", "Blanco, Dairon", "DeJong, Paul",
  "Pham, Tommy", "Gurriel, Yuli", "Grossman, Robbie",
  "Waters, Drew", "Alexander, CJ", "Gentry, Tyler"
)
```

### Filtering and Feauture Engineering
Since our research question is for the Kansas City Royals, we select only games that the KC Royals played in. The vector of royals players is now used to filter any rows where they were at-bat. This ensures that we now only have rows where the opposing team only has hitters since we want to look at KC Royals pitching. Acceleration and velocity each have an x,y, and z variable so to condense the number of variables, we combine the x,y, and z into a single normalized variable for both accelaration and velocity. Our team selected the rest of the columns after research and choosing all columns that could be related to pitching data. Lastly, a new variable was created that determines whether a pitcher was succesful. If the pitcher got a strikeout, fieldout, double_play, strikeout into a double play, force out, fielders choice out, field error, catcher interference (not the pitcher's fault), or a truncated plate appearance, it was recorded as a success. All other outcomes such as singles, doubles, triples, homeruns, sac-bunts, or sac-flys, are recorded as a pitcher's failure.
```{r}
data_baseball <- read.csv("~/Downloads/statcast_pitch_swing_data_20240402_20241030_with_arm_angle.csv", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)


kc_data <- data_baseball %>%
  filter(home_team == "KC" | away_team == "KC") %>%
  filter(!(batter %in% kc_batters)) %>%
  mutate(
    vx0_normalized = scale(vx0),
    vy0_normalized = scale(vy0),
    vz0_normalized = scale(vz0),
    ax_normalized = scale(ax),
    ay_normalized = scale(ay),
    az_normalized = scale(az)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    combined_normalized_velocity = rowMeans(select(., vx0_normalized, vy0_normalized, vz0_normalized)),
    combined_normalized_acceleration = rowMeans(select(., ax_normalized, ay_normalized, az_normalized))
  ) %>% 
  # Exclude rows where the batter is on the KC 2024 roster
  select(
    events, pitcher, batter, release_speed, release_spin_rate, effective_speed, 
    pfx_x, pfx_z, zone, plate_x, plate_z, events, hit_distance_sc, 
    woba_value, delta_pitcher_run_exp, game_date, outs_when_up, 
    home_team, away_team, hc_x, hc_y, description, combined_normalized_velocity, combined_normalized_acceleration, pitch_name,      pitch_type, spin_axis
  ) %>% 
  mutate(pitcher_outcome = case_when(
    events %in% c("strikeout", "field_out", "double_play", "strikeout_double_play", "force_out", "fielders_choice_out",             "field_error", "catcher_interf", "truncated_pa") ~ "success", 
    events %in% c("single", "double", "triple", "home_run", "walk", "hit_by_pitch", 
                  "fielders_choice", "sac_bunt", "sac_fly", "sac_fly_double_play") ~ "fail"  )) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(pitcher_outcome))
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The distributions, correlations, and boxplots of our variables were analyzed using InquisitR package. Since so many graphs are produced during the EDA stage, the output will be excluded.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
distributionR(kc_data)
boxplotR(kc_data)

correlationR(kc_data)
```

## Pitching Analysis
The model shows that the location of where the ball is thrown is important to the pitchers success. This can be visualized in two main ways with the first way being zones compared to hit distances. The 1-9 zones are a strike while 11-14 are balls. Zones 7-9 are lower in the strikezone which shows that the pitchers allow a smaller hit distance when the ball is thrown here. Zones 11-14 are not over the plate (not a strike) which also have a lower hit distance. As our ALE plot shows, a lower hit distance gives a better chance of pitcher success.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(kc_data, aes(x = factor(zone), y = hit_distance_sc, fill = pitcher_outcome)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Hit Distance by Zone and Outcome",
    x = "Pitch Zone",
    y = "Hit Distance",
    fill = "Pitcher Outcome"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("success" = "#004687", "fail" = "#FFA500")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The second way is shown with a heat chart a location of all pitches thrown from the KC Pitchers. A majority of the pitches were thrown down with a wide variety.
```{r}
# Create strike zone coordinates
strike_zone <- data.frame(
  x = c(-0.708, 0.708, 0.708, -0.708, -0.708),  # Horizontal edges (ft from center)
  y = c(1.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 1.5)               # Vertical edges (ft from ground)
)

# Create the heatmap with proper strike zone overlay
ggplot(kc_data, aes(x = plate_x, y = plate_z)) + 
  geom_bin2d() +  
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") + 
  geom_path(
    data = strike_zone, 
    aes(x = x, y = y), 
    color = "black", 
    linewidth = 1) +  
  coord_fixed() +  
  labs(
    title = "Pitch Density Heatmap (KC Pitchers)", 
    x = "Horizontal Location (feet from center)", 
    y = "Vertical Location (feet from ground)"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

This scatterplot shows where hits are located based on hc_x and hx_y. Where there are several gaps in the data is where the defenders stand. The majority of doubles and triples also have a much further hit distance than singles.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Clean version without NA points
ggplot(kc_data, aes(x = hc_x, y = -hc_y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = events), alpha = 0.7) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(
    title = "Hit Ball Locations on the Field (KC Games)", 
    x = "Horizontal Location (hc_x)", 
    y = "Vertical Location (hc_y)", 
    color = "Event Type"
  ) + 
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(
      "single" = "#004687",
      "double" = "#FF5F1F",
      "triple" = "#00B5B8",
      "home_run" = "#F2C800"
    ),
    limits = c("single", "double", "triple", "home_run"),  # Reorder legend
    labels = c("single" = "Single", "double" = "Double", "triple" = "Triple", "home_run" = "Home Run"),  # Rename legend labels
    na.value = NA  # Explicitly remove NA values
  )

```

Release speed was also found as an important 
```{r}
speed_bins_clean <- kc_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(release_speed), !is.na(pitcher_outcome), 
         release_speed >= 70, release_speed <= 100) %>%
  mutate(
    speed_bin = cut(
      release_speed,
      breaks = seq(70, 100, by = 5),
      labels = paste0(seq(70, 95, by = 5), "-", seq(75, 100, by = 5)),
      include.lowest = TRUE
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(speed_bin) %>%
  summarise(success_rate = mean(pitcher_outcome == "success"), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(speed_bins_clean, aes(x = speed_bin, y = success_rate)) +
  geom_col(fill = "blue", width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = percent(success_rate, accuracy = 1)),
    vjust = -0.5, 
    size = 3.5,
    fontface = "bold"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = percent_format(),
    limits = c(0, max(speed_bins_clean$success_rate) * 1.1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Pitcher Success Rate by Release Speed (KC Games",
    x = "Release Speed (mph)",
    y = "Success Rate"
